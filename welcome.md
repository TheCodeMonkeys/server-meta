**.:: Welcome! ::.
Code Monkeys is a discord server dedicated to giving and receiving great help and advice for a variety of programming languages. Help us build a large and friendly community!**

Permanent invite link is <http://discord.me/cm> (or <https://discord.com/invite/Q6nehyS>), please refrain from creating your own permanent ones. (We clear out permanent invite links)

If you need help, DM @MonkeyMail#6775 first. If immediate action is required than you can mention @Staff for the attention of Moderators and Administrators.
Here are some things to keep in mind while being a part of the Code Monkeys Community.

0. Arrays always start at zero.


1. Do not ask if you can ask a question. We can't answer your question if we don't know what it is. (http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html)


2. Common sense, basically... don't do stupid things such as spam or post NSFW. If we have to include something else here, you're not using common sense.

 
3. If you're obviously being a dick, even if you're not violating any of these rules, you will be banned at a staff member's discretion.


4. No malicious/black hat topics in chat. Other hacking belongs in #security.

 
5. Post your things in the right place. Chats have descriptions, #general is for topic discussions, and #spam is for, well... spam (SFW ONLY). etc. Please try not to have extended programming discussions in #general. If you know it's going to be long discussion.

6. Post code/ideas of your projects at your own risk. We are NOT responsible if your intellectual property is stolen.
 
 
7. Don't ask for roles if you're new here, you're simply not going to get them easy if at all.

 
8. If you come across an issue, don't act like a Moderator. Just mention @Staff, and we'll take a look.

 
9. Random links (Discord Servers, Youtube, Twitch, etc.) without permission can/will get you banned. If you REALLY want to advertise your discord server. Throw it up on <https://discord.me/> or post it in #shout-outs.

 
10. Server Administrators reserve the right to kick people who just say "Hi" and nothing else, ever.

 
11. No inappropriate profiles (usernames, nicknames, avatars, linked accounts, playing status). This can include: zalgo, blank names, unusual unicode, political views, attention seeking names, overly lengthy usernames, slurs, or any other offensive material.

 
12. Post code snippets in code blocks.

 
13. Do not Direct Message ANY staff members to inquire about a question, please post it in the appropriate channel.


14. @MonkeyMail#6775 is not intended for programming support please us the respective channels.
